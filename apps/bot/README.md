# Example Bot

This is an example bot built using the discm.js framework.

In `src/` there are a few important files/directories.

- `example.config.json`: The current config the example is using. The config is not framework specific and can be changed to your liking.
- `commands/`: Where all of the bot commands are, as specified when the client is configured in `index.ts`.
- `events/`: Where all of the bot events are, as specified when the client is configured in `index.ts`.
