A framework built on top of and compatible with [discord.js](https://npmjs.com/package/discord.js).

## Installation

You can use our [cli](https://npmjs.com/package/create-discm) to initialize a project.

```shell
npx create-discm@latest
```

It will prompt a series of questions, to skip this use `-y` at the end of the command to bypass all questions.
This will use a set of default values.

> [!NOTE] Using `-y` will initialize the project with javascript automatically. If you wish to use typescript then do not bypass the questions.
